- Low hop count
- Protection against falsified node ID's
- Self repairing in case of node failure
- Almost guaranteed message delivery
- Protection against malicious nodes
- Offline message delivery
- Route locality
- Low redundant messages being send out
- Rate limiting/flood protection for (D)DOS protection
